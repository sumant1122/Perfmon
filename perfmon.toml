# Sample configuration for Perfmon
# Use double brackets [[tab]] to define a new tab.

# Basic uptime command
[[tab]]

# Show memory usage (human readable)
[[tab]]
title = "free memory"
cmd = ["free", "-h"]

# Show disk space usage (human readable)
[[tab]]
title = "disk space"
cmd = ["df", "-h"]

title = "top"
cmd = ["top", "-b", "-n", "1"]

# Show network connections (if netstat is installed)
[[tab]]
